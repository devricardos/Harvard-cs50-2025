# 🗂️ Week 2 - Arrays

In Week 2 of CS50, we focused on arrays, strings, and basic cryptography. Exercises provided hands-on experience with C programming, emphasizing preprocessing, compiling, and debugging.

## 📂 Files / Problem Sets

### 🔐 Problem Sets

- [**caesar.c**](week2-arrays/caesar.c) — Implements Caesar cipher encryption.
- [**readability.c**](week2-arrays/readability.c) — Calculates the readability score of a text using the Coleman-Liau index.
- [**scrabble.c**](week2-arrays/scrabble.c) — Computes the Scrabble score of a word.

### 🛠️ Other Files

- [**buggy.c**](week2-arrays/buggy.c) — Contains intentional bugs for debugging practice.
- [**greet.c**](week2-arrays/greet.c) — Greets the user with a personalized message.
- [**hi.c**](week2-arrays/hi.c) — Prints "Hi, world!" to the console.
- [**length.c**](week2-arrays/length.c) — Calculates the length of a string.
- [**scores.c**](week2-arrays/scores.c) — Computes the average score from a list of scores.
- [**status.c**](week2-arrays/status.c) — Evaluates the status of a student based on their score.
- [**string.c**](week2-arrays/string.c) — Demonstrates basic string operations.
- [**uppercase.c**](week2-arrays/uppercase.c) — Converts a string to uppercase.

## 🛠️ Compilation and Execution

To compile and run each program, use the following commands:

```bash
# Problem sets that require arguments

# Caesar cipher requires a numerical key
make caesar
./caesar 3

# Readability requires a text input
make readability
./readability "Your text here."

# Scrabble computes score for a word
make scrabble
./scrabble "word"

# Programs that do not require command-line arguments
make buggy
./buggy

make greet
./greet

make hi
./hi

make length
./length

make scores
./scores

make status
./status

make string
./string

make uppercase
./uppercase

```
