# Week 1 – C

This week was my first real step into programming with C.  
It felt very different from HTML/CSS, because here I had to think about logic, memory, and how the computer actually executes instructions.

## Programs from lectures
- **compare.c** → compares two numbers and tells which one is bigger or if they are equal.  
- **agree.c** → asks for a yes/no response and handles both uppercase and lowercase input.  
- **cat.c** → asks for a positive number and prints `"meow"` that many times, using loops and helper functions.  
- **calculator.c** → experiments with command-line arguments, converting strings to integers, and doing simple arithmetic.  
- **mario.c** → prints a 3 line # block. A good practice for loops.

## Problem Sets
- **Mario (more)** → prints the *double pyramid*. This one was trickier, because of the nested loops and spacing logic.  
- **Credit** → checks if a credit card number is valid using Luhn’s Algorithm and identifies the card type. This was the hardest one this week and forced me to combine conditionals, loops, and math together.

## What I learned this week
✓ How to use **variables** to store user input.  
✓ How to work with **functions** and why prototypes are needed.  
✓ How **loops** (for, while, do–while) control repetition.  
✓ How to use **conditionals** (if/else) to make decisions.  
✓ Input validation — never trust the first thing the user types.  
✓ Formatting text with `printf` and placeholders like `%i` or `%s`.  
✓ Basics of **command-line arguments** with `argc` and `argv`.  
✓ Applying **algorithms** (greedy, Luhn’s) to solve real problems.

This week I learned that programming is about breaking problems into smaller steps.  
Even with simple exercises, I started to see how logic builds up to bigger solutions.
