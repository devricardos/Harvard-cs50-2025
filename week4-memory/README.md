## 📝 **Notes **  
✓ Hexadecimals (base-16): 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
 - Highest we can go: FF = 15*16 + 15*1 = 255
 - RGB colors (Red Green Blue) = FFFFFF = 255 for every color = Lots of colors (all of them)
 - Bit = smallest possible, can be 0 or 1
 - Byte = group of 8 bits (11001011 = 8 bits = 1 byte)
 - Base-16 = 2⁴ every digit always uses 4 bits, so it is perfect for computers that store info with bytes (8 bits)
 - When humans write hexadecimal numbers we should use 0x1F (sample for 32 in decimal)
